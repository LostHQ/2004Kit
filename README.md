# 2004Kit by Akg (Kaitnieks)
2004Kit is a Python-based client for 2004scape.
It runs the original client, but adds a set of built-in tools designed for player convenience—keeping the authentic experience intact while making it more practical to use.

Simple, functional, and made to enhance the gameplay.

⚠️ Note: Stability hasn’t been thoroughly tested—use at your own responsibility.

**Special thanks to the 2004HQ website creators and contributors, and to the LostCity development team for keeping the nostalgia alive!**

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.9 or higher

### Quick Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd 2004scape-toolkit
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Alternative: Standalone Executable
If you prefer not to install Python, download the pre-compiled `.exe` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/releases) page. The executable runs without requiring Python or any dependencies to be installed.

### Troubleshooting
- **Linux users**: You may need to install system Qt6 libraries: `sudo apt install qt6-webengine-dev`
- **First run**: The application may take a moment to start as it initializes the web engine
